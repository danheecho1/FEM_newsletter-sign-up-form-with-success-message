## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Plain HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Mobile first


### What I learned

I learned two major lessons from this project. 

One is that I should think through the project and plan ahead. I thought I would use plain HTML, CSS and JS without realizing that I need to pass data submitted through a form. Not that I needed routing to accomplish this, but I would have definitely considered React js to utilize state. By the time I realized this, I was already almost done with the project and did not want to start over. 

Another 'aha' moment came from my JavaScript code. I had written the following and could not figure out why it was not working: 

```js
let input = document.querySelector(".sign-up-card-div__info-div__email-div__input").value;
...
const dismiss = () => {
  ...
  input = "";
}
```

Even when ChatGPT corrected me to use the following instead, I had no idea: 

```js
let input = document.querySelector(".sign-up-card-div__info-div__email-div__input");
...
const dismiss = () => {
  ...
  input.value = "";
}
```
After a long thought, I realized that the first code didn't give the input variable a reference to the DOM object that I needed to manipulate; it simply copied the value of the DOM at the time and pasted it to the variable. In comparison, the second code stores a reference to the DOM so that I can access the DOM and manipulate its value.
